#+TITLE gnuplot-mode

This is an emacs major mode for editing gnuplot scripts.  This
provides basic syntax highlighting and indentation, as well as a
command (bound to "C-x p") to call gnuplot on the buffer.

Some of this code is adapted from a more full-featured version by
Bruce Ravel (available here http://xafs.org/BruceRavel/GnuplotMode; CC
