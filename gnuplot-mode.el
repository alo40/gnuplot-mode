;; Version: 1.1.0
;; Keywords: gnuplot, plotting

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; Defines a major mode for editing gnuplot scripts.  I wanted to keep
;; it simpler than other modes -- just syntax hilighting, indentation,
;; and a command to plot the file.

;; Some of this code is adapted from a more full-featured version by
;; Bruce Ravel (available here http://xafs.org/BruceRavel/GnuplotMode;
;; CC license).

;; Thanks to everyone, including Christopher Gilbreth and Ralph MÃ¶ritz,
;; for sending suggestions, improvements, and fixes.

;;; Installation:

;; Use package.el. You'll need to add MELPA to your archives:

;; (require 'package)
;; (add-to-list 'package-archives
;;              '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)

;; Alternatively, you can just save this file and do the standard
;; (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/gnuplot-mode.el")

;;; Configuration:

;; If you installed this via `package.el', you should take advantage
;; of autoloading.  You can customize features using `defvar' and
;; `eval-after-load', as illustrated below:
;;
;; ;; specify the gnuplot executable (if other than "gnuplot")
;; (defvar gnuplot-program "/sw/bin/gnuplot")
;;
;; ;; set gnuplot arguments (if other than "-persist")
;; (defvar gnuplot-flags "-persist -pointsize 2")
;;
;; ;; if you want, add a mode hook.  e.g., the following turns on
;; ;; spell-checking for strings and comments and automatically cleans
;; ;; up whitespace on save.
;; (eval-after-load 'gnuplot-mode
;;   '(add-hook 'gnuplot-mode-hook
;;              (lambda ()
;;                (flyspell-prog-mode)
;;                (add-hook 'before-save-hook
;;                          'whitespace-cleanup nil t))))

;; If you installed this file manually, you probably don't want to
;; muck around with autoload commands.  Instead, add something like
;; the following to your .emacs:

;; (require 'gnuplot-mode)
;;
;; ;; specify the gnuplot executable (if other than "gnuplot")
;; (setq gnuplot-program "/sw/bin/gnuplot")
;;
;; ;; set gnuplot arguments (if other than "-persist")
;; (setq gnuplot-flags "-persist -pointsize 2")
;;
;; ;; if you want, add a mode hook.  e.g., the following turns on
;; ;; spell-checking for strings and comments and automatically cleans
;; ;; up whitespace on save.
;; (add-hook 'gnuplot-mode-hook
;;           (lambda ()
;;             (flyspell-prog-mode)
;;             (add-hook 'before-save-hook
;;                       'whitespace-cleanup nil t)))

;;; TODO:
;;  1. the indentation commands use regular expressions, which
;;     probably isn't ideal.  is it possible to rework them to use the
;;     syntax table?
;;
;;  2. (related) the indentation scheme fails to recognize the last
;;     lines of commands if they have a "\" anywhere in them (e.g., in
;;     a string).  this is ok, but not ideal
;;
;;  3. make the gnuplot errors work like a compile buffer.  e.g., have
;;     commands like `next-error' and `previous-error'.  that would be
;;     nice, but it sounds like a lot of work.
